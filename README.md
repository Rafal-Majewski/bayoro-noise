# bayoro-noise
Bayoro noise is a type of noise alternative to perlin, simplex and value noise.
The main difference is that the noise is calculated *in situ* meaning no other points are calculated except the point you want to get height in.

For now, the noise can't be looped in dimensions higher than 1D.

## Theory
The algorithm basically calculates a sum of scaled, rotated and shifted sinuses (called *coefficients* throughout the documentation), that are divided into layers.

Inspired by [the Weierstrass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function) and [the Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform).

```
let coefficients=[
	{
		shift: 2*PI*random(), // shift is a random number between <0;2*PI)
		amplitude: 1, // sinus' amplitude, should decrease geometrically with each layer
		frequency: 1 // sinus' frequency, should increase geometrically with each layer
	},
	{
		shift: 2*PI*random(),
		amplitude: 0.5,
		frequency: 2
	},
	{
		shift: 2*PI*random(),
		amplitude: 0.25,
		frequency: 4
	},
];

function noise(x) {
	let sum=0; // variable to store height
	// iterate over all coefficients
	for (let i=0; i<n; ++i) {
		let coef=coefficients[i];
		sum+=coef.amplitude*sin(coef.shift+x*coef.frequency);
	}
	return sum;
}
